            //Future:
            // In short, the more decisions you make with particular setting setup, the more precize is the prediction of time and accuracy. For first decision in case of choosen setting, approximated values for accuracy and time were inserted, with respect to number of qualities and options.. There are other factors which may affect accuracy which were not incorporated here. For example number of qualities and options. THe more options and qualities, the more accurate is the comparison.
            //Problem: accuracy can be highly affected by number of options and qualities. In the future create trend line function (from statistics) to know what will be estimated accuracy for particular number of options and qualities. Gather data for 4 situations: no system, turboMode on, accuracyMode on, turbo and accuracyModeOn. In each situation check how accuracy will depend on number of options and number of qualities. Then when user will choose situation 1, provide estimation for situation 1 (no system), when he will choose situation 2, provide estimation for situation 2. This way we will know that estimate accuracy in each situation really depend on num of options and qualities, not because of using the system. Then we will add to accuracy appropriate values depending on which system was/wasn't used, thanks to data collected in our dataBase. By measuring accuracy provided by switiching on a system we need to remember to compare accuracies (one accuracy with using system and one without a system) which have similar number of options and criterias. This way we will have reliable information how particular system affects accuracy.
            // in the future use averages from data base, not hard coded numbers, I shoud create helper for it.

            //Now
            // Solution for problem now (find better in the future) - you can increasy accuracy maximaly to 60% by increasing num of qualities and options. The rest can be increased by using particualr system. All is estimated from nowhere and not based on data.
